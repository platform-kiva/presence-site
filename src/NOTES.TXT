Checklist
- When returning back to Product page from Cart, make sure the last item viewed before going to Cart is displayed
    - Some mix-up with using setProductInd sets the last viewed cart item as the first view Product item
- Fix clicking on TopFold product image to scroll, it's currently being triggered by any mouse click
- Responsive design
- Implement persistantancy so refresh doesn't reset Product/gradient
- Implement product size into CartContext data (Add to cart adds size, not so much the need for quantity except adding for total Cart quantity, perhaps stored separately)

Considerations
- More microinteractions
- Need to create ColorsContext/ProductContext?
    - Because of themed UI, is it better to separate Product data from Product colors?
    - Maybe not, as the data being pulled is used in multiple places (Product, Cart), it may make more sense to keep bundled
