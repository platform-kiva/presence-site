Checklist
- Add clicking on TopFold product image to scroll
- Responsive design

Considerations
- More microinteractions
- Need to create ColorsContext/ProductContext?
    - Because of themed UI, is it better to separate Product data from Product colors?
    - Maybe not, as the data being pulled is used in multiple places (Product, Cart), it may make more sense to keep bundled
