Checklist
- When OrderForm loads, scroll to view component
- NavBtn: sync arrow/btn hover, expand carusel btn to include description text (View More, Cart, Checkout)
- Add clicking on TopFold product image to scroll, (OR DISPLAY ADDTOCARTBUTTON)
- Responsive design
- Make productInd persistant to keep currently viewed product on refresh

Considerations
- More microinteractions
- Need to create ColorsContext/ProductContext?
    - Because of themed UI, is it better to separate Product data from Product colors?
    - Maybe not, as the data being pulled is used in multiple places (Product, Cart), it may make more sense to keep bundled
